In this new version of the Let's Make a Deal game, it is assumed that Monty Hall does not know which door the car is behind and may accidentally reveal the location of the car before the contestant has had the opportunity to switch doors.  If this happens, the game is forfeited or annulled and the contestant is asked to play the game again.</P>
